# Code Along Exercise 3 Starting Code

## Overview

In this code along exercise we will use the CSS box model to size our elements and add spacing around and within them.

To accomplish this we will make the following changes:

 - Create css/layout.css to set display and add sizing, padding, margin to our common layout elements. Also add a class of product-details and apply it to our product pages. Link it in css/main.css.
 - Create css/table.css to add padding, margin, border styles to our tables.
 - Create css/nav.css to set display and padding and margin spacing for our main navigation. Create classes for main-nav and social-nav to adjust their styling differently. Apply the main-nav and style-nav classes to all HTML pages. remove spacing between nav links to prevent line-returns on inline-block elements from appearing as white character spaces.
 - Create css/form.css to set display and add padding and margin to our form elements. Link it in css/main.css.
 - In css/typography add margin and padding to headings and unordered lists.
